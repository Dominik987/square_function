\title{
read_dta{haven}
}
\description{
Currently haven can read and write logical, integer, numeric, character and factors. See labelled() for how labelled variables in Stata are handled in R.
}
\usage{
read_dta(file, encoding = NULL)
}
\arguments{
  \item{file}{
Either a path to a file, a connection, or literal data (either a single string or a raw vector).
Files ending in .gz, .bz2, .xz, or .zip will be automatically uncompressed. Files starting with http://, https://, ftp://, or ftps:// will be automatically downloaded. Remote gz files can also be automatically downloaded and decompressed.
Literal data is most useful for examples and tests. It must contain at least one new line to be recognised as data (instead of a path).
}
\item{encoding}{
The character encoding used for the file. Generally, only needed for Stata 13 files and earlier. See Encoding section for details.
}
}
\value{
A tibble, data frame variant with nice defaults.

Variable labels are stored in the "label" attribute of each variable. It is not printed on the console, but the RStudio viewer will show it.
